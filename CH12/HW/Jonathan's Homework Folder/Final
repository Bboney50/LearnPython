 
Will be working on final during todays final time, I wanted to get all the homework in, and I was really close to being able to, but I spent 2-3 hoours on this button things, and I can not figure out why my little red X wont close the window, which was my test button before I started coding all the other buttons in the gui.

Oh well, layout is there, and in one of those folders somewhere, is the gamemode, basically everything was there just had to put it together and couldnt, got to get ready for this final, then will be in computer lab (while nicole is taking her final) working on the final in this class.
