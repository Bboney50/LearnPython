This program reads an input file that will have the necessary information from a pitcher on it, 
and calculate the percentage that the pitcher throws a certain pitch in each count, and the 
percentage that each pitch is thrown for a strike. 

The user will fill out the given Microsoft excel chart, then copy the information to the given
input file. From there, the program will read the input file and give the information on the 
given output file. 

The user can then copy the newly-found information onto a different file for storage. 

A copy of information is included in the input file from a UAM pitcher for testing.
