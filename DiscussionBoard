Post comments and questions about the class. 
Need help with homework or have a solution for others? Post it here.

Once you finish typing your post on your local copy, submit it as a pull request. By the way, most things git needed by us is covered in chapter 2: Git-Basics of the free textbook Pro Git at http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2.

Be sure and be specific enough when you ask a question that other people can understand what the problem is.
