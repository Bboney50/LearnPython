Dr. Burrows, initial post 1/11/16:

Post comments and questions about the class. 
Need help with homework or have a solution for others? Post it here.

Once you finish typing your post on your local copy, submit it as a pull request. By the way, most things git needed by us is covered in chapter 2: Git-Basics of the free textbook Pro Git at http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2.

Be sure and be specific enough when you ask a question that other people can understand what the problem is.

January 13th, 2016. Evan Comeau:
I play baseball for UAM, set to graduate this semester. I plan to teach math in university some day. I'm a mathematics major with a teaching and learning minor. 

1/14/16, studentRoss: This note was posted from the computer lab on Comp-06.
first I created and logged into the studentRoss account on github.com
then I forked https://github.com/elrossco2/LearnPython.git to get a copy at https://github.com/studentRoss/LearnPython.git
Then I launched the Git Shell and did:

> git clone https://github.com/studentRoss/LearnPython.git
> cd LearnPython
> git remote add elrossco https://github.com/elrossco2/LearnPython.git
> git remote -v
> git pull elrossco master

This pulled down and merged all the stuff I didn't have yet.
